# Web-Scraping

In order to scrape the website, I have used Scrapy. In short, Scrapy is a framework built to build web scrapers more easily and relieve the pain of maintaining them. Basically, it allows us to focus on the data extraction using CSS selectors and choosing XPath expressions and less on the intricate internals of how spiders are supposed to work. 

The code to extract the data and return the class is present in items.py file.
The code for spider(classes that you define) used to scrape information from a website (or a group of websites) is present in fundrazr_ scrape.py file under spiders subfolder. 

Hope this helps!!
